# Dictionary-Python-Project
This is a project I built in intro to programming
This uses dictionary's in python to allow the user to input the phrase and output how many times each character in that phrase occurred 
in a list and the score of each character and the score of that phrase.
This data is taken from a file called movies_list.txt which containts data from movie reviews. 
 

Scores:
0 : negative
1 : somewhat negative
2 : neutral
3 : somewhat positive
4 : positive
In this way, this program sifts through movies_list.txt and looks at each character and its movie review, and 
decides based on those two things
what the score should be.
